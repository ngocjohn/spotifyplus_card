###### [ 1.0.8 ] - 2024/10/27

###### [ 1.0.7 ] - 2024/10/25

  * Added an outline to the player progress bar.
  * Fixed background color of card title when player is turned off.

###### [ 1.0.6 ] - 2024/10/24

  * Updated `fav-browser-base` to check for the existence of `search-input-outlined` and `ha-md-button-menu` controls in the `customElements` array, and force a load of the controls if they are not present.  These controls may not be loaded by default when a page refresh (F5) occurs, so they must be forced to load in order to render correctly on the page.
